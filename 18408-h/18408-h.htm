<h4>THE NEW YORK TUNNEL EXTENSION OF THE<br>
PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD.<br>
THE SITE OF THE TERMINAL
STATION.<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a></h4>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">By George C. Clarke, M. Am. Soc. C. E.</h5>

<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The purpose of this paper is to describe the preliminary work for and
the preparation of that portion of the site for the Terminal Station in
Manhattan, of the New York Tunnel Extension of the Pennsylvania
Railroad, which was constructed under the direction of the Chief
Engineer of the East River Division, including the disposal of material
excavated from all parts of the Terminal construction and the tunnels on
the East River Division.</p>

<p>As outlined in the paper by Brigadier-General Charles W. Raymond,
M.&nbsp;Am. Soc. C.&nbsp;E., Chairman of the Board of Engineers,
the track yard of
the station, <a href = "#plate_LIII">Plate&nbsp;LIII</a>, extends from
the east line of Tenth Avenue eastward to points in 32d and 33d Streets,
respectively, 292 and 502 ft. east of the west line of Seventh Avenue.
The width of the available area at track level at Tenth Avenue is 213
ft., continuing at this width to within 182 ft. of the west line of
Ninth Avenue, where, by an offset toward the south, it is increased to
355 ft. This width is held to a point 5 ft. east of the east line of
Ninth Avenue, where, by an offset toward the north, it is increased to
509 ft., which width continues to the west line of Seventh Avenue, where
it divides into two fan-shaped areas. The north area has a width of
about 170
<span class = "pagenum">341</span>
<a name = "page341"> </a>
ft. and the south one, 160 ft., at the house line, each area tapering
gradually to the width of the standard three-track tunnel at the east
ends, noted above in 33d and 32d Streets. Additional track room for four
tail-tracks is gained by the construction of two double-track tunnels
under Ninth Avenue at 33d Street, their center lines being parallel to
the street and 45.5 and 84.5 ft. distant, respectively, from the north
house line. An additional width of 24.5 ft. is occupied on the north
from 277.5 ft. to 543.5 ft. west of the west line of Seventh Avenue,
where the buildings on the north side of 33d Street have been torn down
and the enclosing wall set back in anticipation of a future outlet to
34th Street; and on the south, from 459 ft. to 597 ft. west of the west
line of Seventh Avenue a rectangular offset of 124 ft. encloses the area
occupied by the Service Building. The total area above outlined is the
space occupied at track level, and amounts to 28 acres, of which the
portion west of the east house line of Ninth Avenue and south of a line
107.3 ft. south of the south line of 33d Street is a part of the North
River Division, and was constructed under the direction of the engineers
of that Division; the fan-shaped areas east of the west house line of
Seventh Avenue were constructed under the direction of the Chief
Engineer of Electric Traction and Terminal Station Construction.</p>

Pennsylvania Station, New York City:<br>
Plan Showing Area at Track Level</span>
</p>

<p>In June, 1903, when the writer's connection with the work began, the
preliminary surveys had been completed and the location and extent of
the Terminal track area had been fixed, in so far as the city blocks to
be occupied were concerned. This contemplated area, however, did not
include the portion between Ninth and Tenth Avenues, that being added
subsequently. The elevation of the track level had also been fixed by
the requirement in the agreement with the City that no part of the
permanent structure should approach within 19 ft. of the surface under
any avenue or under any street except within the Terminal area. The
nearest approach of the tracks to the surface is at a point 320 ft. east
of Eighth Avenue, where the top of the rail is 40 ft. below the 31st
Street curb line.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Wash-Borings.</h5>

<p>The general plan of enclosing the area in retaining walls having been
adopted, wash-borings were taken, for the purpose of determining the
best location for the walls, the depth of rock, and the nature of
<span class = "pagenum">342</span>
<a name = "page342"> </a>
the material overlying it. These borings were made along both curb lines
of Seventh Avenue, the east curb line of Ninth Avenue, the north curb
line of 33d Street, and the south curb line of 31st Street. The borings,
as a rule, were taken at intervals of approximately 100 ft., some
deviation in these intervals being made in order to prevent injury to
water, gas, and sewer connections, and, if the elevation of the surface
of the rock, as determined by one of these borings, corresponded fairly
well with the borings on either side of it, no intermediate borings were
taken. When a discrepancy appeared, a boring was taken midway between
the two non-corresponding ones, and if the information obtained from the
intermediate boring failed to account for the discrepancy, others were
taken at the quarter points of the original 100-ft. interval.</p>

<p>The dotted lines on <a href = "#fig_1">Fig.&nbsp;1</a> show the
profiles of the surface of the rock underlying 31st and 33d Streets, on
the line of the borings, constructed from the elevations obtained by
them; the solid lines show the profiles of the actual surface of the
rock as found when uncovered. It will be noted that, except in three
cases, Borings 313, 328, and 333, the two profiles correspond very
closely at the points where the borings were made, but they differ
widely between those points, a variation of 5 ft. being common; there is
a variation of 14 ft. between Borings 324 and 327, and between Nos. 337
and 340; and of 12 ft. between Nos. 333 and 335, and between Nos. 312
and 313, while an extreme variation of 17 ft. is shown between Nos. 303
and 305. At each of the points where the variation is great the interval
between borings is the full 100 ft., and it is quite apparent that, if a
definite idea is to be obtained of the elevation of the surface of the
rock in Manhattan, borings must be taken at shorter intervals.</p>

<p>The necessary width of trench for the construction of the retaining
walls was determined by the elevation of the rock, as shown by the
borings, and only in the case of the dip between Borings 303 and 305 did
the variation lead to any difficulty. The trench at that point had to be
widened after rock was reached. This depression corresponded very
closely in location to that of one arm of the creek shown on General
Viele's map of 1865,<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" href = "#note2">2</a>
the bed of that stream, or one in approximately
<span class = "pagenum">344</span>
<a name = "page344"> </a>
the same location, being clearly marked across the excavation by
smoothly-worn rock and well-rounded boulders. The original stream,
however, seemed to have turned in a westerly direction under 31st Street
to Eighth Avenue instead of crossing, as shown on General
Viele's&nbsp;map.</p>

PROFILE OF ROCK SURFACES IN THIRTY-FIRST AND THIRTY-THIRD STREETS,<br>
BETWEEN SEVENTH AND NINTH AVENUES.</span>
</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Sewers.</h5>

<p>The arrangement of the sewers in the streets in the vicinity of the
Terminal Site, previous to the beginning of the construction, and the
drainage area tributary to those sewers, is shown by <a href =
"#fig_2">Fig.&nbsp;2</a>. The main sewer for this district was in Eighth
Avenue, and was a 6-ft. circular brick conduit within the Terminal area.
The sewers leading to it from the west, in 31st, 32d, and 33d Streets,
were elliptical, 3 by 2 ft., and egg-shaped, 4 ft. by 2 ft. 8 in.,
although in no case did they drain more than one block, and they were on
a heavy grade. Draining into Eighth Avenue from the east, the one on
31st Street was 4 ft. by 2 ft. 8 in., egg-shaped, and drained a length
of two blocks, and those on 32d and 33d Streets were circular, 4 ft. in
diameter, and drained the territory for three blocks, or as far east as
Fifth Avenue. There were no sewers in Seventh Avenue within the Terminal
area, except small vitrified pipes, each less than 200 ft. in
length.</p>

<p>It was desirable that the size and number of the sewers in the
streets and avenues surrounding the Terminal should be reduced to a
minimum, on account of the difficulty of caring for them during
construction and also to reduce the probability of sewage leaking into
the underground portion of the work after its completion. With this in
view, the plan was adopted of building an intercepting sewer down
Seventh Avenue from north of 33d Street to the 30th Street sewer, which,
being a 4-ft. circular conduit, was sufficiently large to carry all the
sewage coming from east of Seventh Avenue and south of 34th Street. It
was decided to build this sewer of cast iron where it crossed the
proposed construction work, and also to replace with cast iron the brick
sewers on 31st, 32d, and 33d Streets from Seventh Avenue to a point east
of the west end of the standard tunnel section, and also the sewer on
Eighth Avenue from the north side of 33d Street to the south side of
31st Street. This arrangement permitted: first, the removal of the sewer
in 32d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, which was necessary,
as that street was to be excavated; second, the reduction of the sewer
in Eighth Avenue from a
<span class = "pagenum">346</span>
<a name = "page346"> </a>
6-ft. to a 5-ft. circular conduit; and, third, assuming that the sewage
and drainage from the Terminal would be pumped directly to the sewers in
the avenues, the reduction of the sewers in 31st and 33d Streets, from
Seventh to Ninth Avenue, to 15-in. vitrified pipes, except west of the
Service Building in 31st Street, to accommodate which section, a larger
sewer was required. The sewer in 32d Street, from Ninth to Eighth
Avenue, of course, could be dispensed with in any arrangement, as all
the area tributary to it was to be excavated.</p>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Gas and Water Mains.</h5>

<p>A rearrangement of the gas pipes in the three streets crossing the
Terminal site was necessary. These pipes were of two classes: trunk
mains and service mains. Fortunately, there were but two trunk mains in
the three streets, one a 20-in. in 31st Street from east of Seventh
Avenue to Ninth Avenue, the other a 16-in. in 32d Street from east of
Seventh Avenue to Eighth Avenue. The 20-in. main was relaid from Seventh
Avenue and 31st Street down Seventh Avenue to 30th Street and through
that street to Ninth Avenue. The 16-in. main was relaid from Seventh
Avenue and 32d Street north to 34th Street and through that street to
Eighth Avenue. The service mains in 32d Street were no longer required,
and were taken up and not replaced. The houses on 31st and 33d Streets
were provided with service by two 6-in. wrought-iron mains back of the
retaining walls in each street, that location being chosen to avoid
damage by gas drip to the water-proofing of the street bridges. As the
permanent structures under the avenues were not to approach the surface
nearer than 19 ft., only slight rearrangements, sufficient to permit the
new sewers and water lines to be laid, were necessary.</p>

<p>There were no large water mains to be cared for, in fact, those in
the streets were too small for ample fire protection, being only 6 in.
in diameter. The main in 32d Street was taken up and not replaced, and
those on 31st and 33d Streets were replaced by 12-in. pipes laid back of
the retaining walls. No changes were necessary in the mains in the
avenues, but, before approving the rearrangement for the streets, the
Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity added a 48-in. main in
Eighth Avenue to be laid as a part of this construction, the pipe being
supplied by the City.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">347</span>
<a name = "page347"> </a>

<h5 class = "smallcaps">Location and Design of Retaining Walls.</h5>

<p>The plans, from the earliest stages, contemplated founding the
retaining wall on the surface of the rock, where of suitable quality,
and afterward excavating the rock in front of the toe of the wall to
sub-grade. This plan was definitely adopted soon after the borings were
completed, on account of the great danger of blasting out large
quantities of rock in timbered trenches close to buildings founded on
soft material, and also to avoid the additional cost and delay that
would have been caused by carrying the walls to sub-grade. The retaining
walls in Seventh Avenue, south of the viaduct, and in Ninth Avenue,
north of the viaduct, were not governed by the same conditions as in the
streets. The dip and quality of the rock at both points required that
the walls be carried to sub-grade, and they are, in fact, face walls;
the Ninth Avenue wall, in particular, having little thrust to sustain,
is very light.</p>

<p>The results aimed at in the design and location of the retaining
walls in 31st and 33d Streets were:</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>First.</i>&mdash;A perfectly stable wall under all conditions that
might reasonably be expected;
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Second.</i>&mdash;As much room as possible at the elevation of the
top of rail;
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Third.</i>&mdash;The least necessary interference with adjoining
property during construction; and,
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;The most economical wall that would fulfill the
other conditions.
</p>

<p>As stated in the paper by Alfred Noble, Past-President, Am. Soc. C.
E., the third stipulation required the relinquishing of a portion of the
space under these streets granted by the City, but it was finally
decided not to approach the south house line of 31st Street with the
back of the walls nearer than 9 ft., while on 33d Street the extreme
position of the back was fixed at the north line, as there were no
buildings, except those belonging to the Railroad Company, on the house
line at the low points in the rock.</p>

<p>The assumptions made in designing the wall were as follows:</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>First.</i>&mdash;Weight of concrete, 140 lb. per cu. ft.
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Second.</i>&mdash;Weight of material from the surface of the ground
to a depth of 12 ft. (which was shown by tests made in bore-holes
<span class = "pagenum">348</span>
<a name = "page348"> </a>
to be the elevation of the ground-water surface), 100 lb. per cu. ft.;
and angle of repose, 30 degrees. The distance of 12 ft. below the
surface was the depth of the inverts of the sewers, which undoubtedly
drained the ground above them, thus accounting for the standing of the
ground-water in planes practically parallel with the surface.
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Third.</i>&mdash;Weight of buildings back of wall neglected, as that
of the present type will about equal the cellars filled with material at
100 lb. per cu. ft., and if large buildings are erected in the future
they will undoubtedly be carried to rock.
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Fourth.</i>&mdash;Reaction from superstructure, live and dead load,
20,000 lb. per lin. ft. of wall.
</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Fifth.</i>&mdash;Weight of materials below the 12-ft. line, 124 lb.
per cu. ft., ascertained as follows: The material was considered as
weighing 165 lb. per cu. ft. in the solid, and having 40% of voids
filled with water at 62.5 lb. per cu. ft., the resulting weight being
(165&nbsp;×&nbsp;60/100) + (62.5&nbsp;×&nbsp;40/100) = 124 lb. per cu.
ft.
</p>

<p>Various angles of repose were used for this material in the
investigation, and it was finally decided that 30° was the greatest
angle that could be expected, whereas the worst condition that could be
anticipated was that the sand and water would act separately and give a
pressure as follows:</p>

<p>Hydraulic pressure from liquid weighing 62.5 lb. per cu. ft. plus
pressure from sand with angle of repose at 30° and weight as
follows:</p>

<p>Weight of 1 cu. ft. in air = 165 × 60/100 = 99 lb.</p>

<p>Weight of water displaced by 1 cu. ft. = 60/100 × 62.5 lb. =
37.5&nbsp;lb.</p>

<p>Weight in water, therefore = 61.5 lb. per cu. ft.</p>

<p>These combined weights, of course, are equal to the weight of the
combined material in the previous assumption.</p>

<p class = "hanging">
<i>Sixth.</i>&mdash;The usual requirement that the resultant of both
horizontal and vertical forces should, at all points, fall within the
middle third of the wall, or, in other words, that there should be no
tension in the concrete.
</p>

<p>With these assumptions, investigation was made of walls with various
batters and differently designed backs. This investigation developed
<span class = "pagenum">349</span>
<a name = "page349"> </a>
the fact that the reaction from the superstructure was so great that,
for economy, both in first cost and space occupied, the batter must be
sufficient to cause that reaction to fall within or very close to the
middle third. Nothing could have been gained by having that reaction
fall back of the front of the middle third, as the wall was required to
be stable against the full pressure before the superstructure was
erected, and in case it should ever be removed; or, to state the matter
more clearly, the reaction from the superstructure was so great in
comparison to the weight of the wall, that, if it fell in front of the
resultant of all the other forces, the width of base required would be
greatly increased to make the wall stable after the superstructure was
erected; whereas, if the reaction from the superstructure fell back of
the resultant of all the other forces, the width of base could not be
correspondingly decreased without danger of the wall being overturned
before the superstructure was erected. The least batter that would
answer those conditions was found to be 2 in. per&nbsp;ft.</p>

<p>For convenience in designing, and economy in constructing, the
steelwork, the faces of the bridge seat and of the backwall were laid
parallel to the center line of the Terminal, and in elevation on line
parallel to the top of the curb and as near to it as the economical
depth of steel would permit, without bringing the finished construction
above the plane fixed in the ordinance. As there is a variation of 13
ft. in the elevation of the top of the curb of 31st Street above the top
of rail and a variation of 18 ft. in 33d Street, a uniform batter, with
the top parallel to the center line, would produce a toe varying in
distance from it and from the other constructions. It was decided,
therefore, for the sake of appearance, to make the face of the wall (or
wall produced) at the top of rail parallel to the center line, and to
vary the batter accordingly, using the 2-in. batter previously mentioned
as the minimum. This gave a maximum batter of 3 in. per ft. The
variation is so gradual that it is unnoticeable, and is not sufficient
to introduce any complications in construction.</p>

<p>The wall was designed with a stepped back, primarily to allow the
water-proofing and brick protection to be held in position more readily.
The first step was put at 13 ft. below the surface of the ground. This
gave a vertical back above that point for a 3-in. battered face, and a
slightly battered back for sections having a less batter in front. Below
that point a step was added for each 5 ft. of depth
<span class = "pagenum">350</span>
<a name = "page350"> </a>
to the elevation of the top of rail, or to the foundation of the wall if
above that elevation. As the horizontal distance of the heel of the
wall, at its greatest width, from its face at the top of rail would
determine the effective room to be occupied by the wall, it was
determined to make the back vertical below the top of rail and gain the
necessary increase in width below that point by making a heavy batter on
the face.</p>

<p>The type of wall having been thus determined, calculations were made
of the width of base required for each ¼-in. batter from 2 to 3 in.,
inclusive, first for a depth of 13 ft. below the top of the curb and
then for each 5 ft. below that elevation, to a depth corresponding to
the distance between the top of the curb and the top of the rail at the
point of greatest variation. These widths of wall were determined for
the two pressures previously decided on, and curves were then plotted
showing the thickness of wall required for each batter calculated and
for each pressure. They are shown on <a href =
"#plate_LIV">Plate&nbsp;LIV</a>. The curves in broken lines represent
the widths required for saturated material, and the curves in dotted
lines for hydraulic pressure. Mean curves were then drawn between each
broken and its corresponding dotted curve. These are shown in solid
lines, and represent the widths of wall which were used in the
construction. Typical sections of the wall and pipes back of it are
shown on <a href = "#fig_3">Fig.&nbsp;3</a>.</p>

<p>The extreme positions of the back of the wall on the two streets
having been determined, as previously stated, the width of base required
at those points fixed the toe of the wall at the top of rail as 254.5
ft. south of the center line of the Terminal in 31st Street, and 258.5
ft. north of the center line in 33d Street.</p>

</p>
<p><i>2.</i>&mdash;The second contract, dated February 10th, 1905, was
with the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, for the
excavation for and construction of retaining walls for the Manhattan
Terminal Power Station, and the excavation of the area thus
enclosed.</p>

<p><i>3.</i>&mdash;The third contract, dated October 2d, 1907, was with
the New York Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, for the
construction of two twin tunnels under Ninth Avenue, and other work
incidental thereto.</p>

<p>Sewers and gas mains laid outside the area covered by the foregoing
contracts were constructed under the following agreements:</p>

<p>An agreement, dated August 9th, 1904, between the New York
Contracting Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, and the New Amsterdam Gas
Company, for a 20-in. gas main from Seventh Avenue and 31st Street to
30th Street, and thence to Ninth Avenue, the New Amsterdam Gas Company
being remunerated for the cost by the Tunnel Company.</p>

<p>A contract, dated August 24th, 1904, with the New York Contracting
Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, for the construction of sewers in Seventh
Avenue and in 32d and 33d Streets east of Seventh Avenue.</p>

<p>A contract, dated November 24th, 1908, with the New York Contracting
Company-Pennsylvania Terminal, for the construction of a 16-in. gas main
from Seventh Avenue and 32d Street to 34th Street, and thence to Eighth
Avenue.</p>

<p>All these contracts required that the excavated material be delivered
on board scows to be furnished by the company at the pier at the foot of
32d Street, North River. These scows were furnished and the material was
disposed of from that point by Henry Steers, Incorporated, under a
contract, dated August 9th, 1904, which called for
<span class = "pagenum">353</span>
<a name = "page353"> </a>
the transportation to and placing of all material so delivered in the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company's freight terminal at
Greenville, N.&nbsp;Y.</p>

<p>The disposal of the excavated material was one of the principal
features of the work, and, under the above contract, material from those
portions of the Terminal site east of Seventh Avenue and west of Ninth
Avenue, and from all substructures work, was disposed of, as well as
from the constructions herein described. The problem differed from that
presented by the usual foundation excavations in New York City in
magnitude only, and the methods were not unusual, but were adaptations
of the usual ones to exceptionally large work.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Piers and Trestle for Disposal.</h5>

<p>The most rapid and economical handling of all excavated material to
scows was made possible by the Tunnel Company procuring from the New
York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company the pier at the foot of
32d Street, North River, known in the earlier stages of the work as Pier
No. 62, but subsequently changed to Pier No. 72, and thus referred to in
this paper. This pier was occupied by a freight-shed used by the New
York Central Railroad Company, under a long-term lease from the City,
and that Company had to make numerous changes in their tracks and
adjoining piers before No. 72 could be turned over; the contract for the
excavation, therefore, required the contractor to procure any piers
needed previous to and in addition to it. Under this clause of the
agreement, the contractor procured one-half of the pier at 35th Street,
North River, which was used for the disposal of all material excavated
previous to May 22d, 1905, on which date Pier No. 72 was first put in
service.</p>

<p>As the type of plant the contractor would elect to use could not be
determined, previous to the letting of the contract, a general plan for
Pier No. 72 and the trestle approach, suitable for either trains or
wagons, was attached to the contract, and the details were worked out
afterward. The method adopted was by train, and a two-track approach to
the pier was provided. Beginning on the east side of Ninth Avenue, at
the south line of 32d Street, at an elevation of 20 ft. below the
surface, crossing under Ninth Avenue and to the center line of 32d
Street, it rose on a 1.5% grade in open cut to the surface of 32d Street
at a point 500 ft. west of Tenth Avenue, from which point it rose above
the surface of the street on a timber trestle to Tenth Avenue, which
<span class = "pagenum">354</span>
<a name = "page354"> </a>
was crossed overhead. West of Tenth Avenue the line changed by a reverse
curve to the south sidewalk of 32d Street, and continued on a timber
trestle, practically level, to the New York Central Yard tracks near
Eleventh Avenue. These tracks and Eleventh Avenue were crossed overhead
on a through-truss, steel bridge, and a column-and-girder construction
on which the two tracks separated to a distance of 29 ft, between center
lines, so as to bring them directly over the posts of special timber
bents which spanned the two house tracks of the New York Central
south-bound freight shed, which the trestle here paralleled. This
position was held to a point 25 ft. west of the east house line of
Twelfth Avenue, where, by a system of cross-overs and turn-outs, access
was had from either track to six tracks on the pier. Four of these were
on upper decks, two on the north and two on the south edge of the pier,
at an elevation of 41 ft. above mean high tide, to carry earth and small
rock to chutes from which it was dumped into barges. The other two
tracks proceeded by a 5.3% grade down the center of the pier to the
lower deck where, at a distance of 540 ft. from the bulkhead, and beyond
the upper deck construction, they diverged into six, two on the north
and two on the south edge of the pier for standing tracks to serve
derricks, and two down the center for shifting purposes. A siding to the
north of the two running tracks just west of the bottom of the incline
served a bank of eight electric telphers. The arrangement of the pier is
shown by <a href = "#fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

PLANT FOR DISPOSAL OF EXCAVATED MATERIALS<br>
PIER NO. 72 N.R.</span>
</p>

<p>The trestle east of the steel structure at Eleventh Avenue had simple
four-post bents, as shown by Bent "<i>A</i>," on <a href =
"#fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>, all posts being vertical, to save room at the
street level; the outside posts and the caps and sills were of 12 by
12-in. timber; the intermediate posts were of 8 by 12-in. timber; and
single or double decks of 3 by 8-in. bracing were used, depending on the
height of the bents. These bents were framed on the ground in position
and raised by hand. West of Tenth Avenue, the sills of the bents rested
on four 12 by 12-in. longitudinal timbers, each spanning two bays and
breaking joints, for convenience in supporting the trestle while the
tunnels were constructed in open cut beneath. These bents were placed 12
ft. on centers, with one 8 by 16-in. stringer under each rail, and one 6
by 16-in. jack-stringer supporting the overhang of the floor on either
side.</p>

DETAIL OF BENTS FOR MATERIAL TRESTLE.</span>
</p>

<p>The method of erection was as follows: An excavation was made on the
line of each post, 4 ft. deep and from 4 to 5 ft. square, depending on
whether it was for a single or reinforced post; 6 in. of concrete was
placed in the bottom, and on this were laid, at right angles to the
center of the trench, three 8 by 12-in. timbers varying in length with
the excavation from 3 to 4 ft. To these timbers was drifted one 12 by
12-in. timber of the same length as those in the bottom row, but at
right angles to them. Elevations were then taken on top of the 12 by
12-in. timber, and the bent was framed complete and of correct height.
The framing was done south of the line of the trestle and west of the
freight-house. The framed bents were picked up by a small two-boom
traveler carrying two double-drum, electric, hoisting engines, and run
forward into position. A hole had previously been made in the metal
gutter and canopy of the freight-house, by an experienced roofer, and in
the freight platform underneath, and, as soon as the bent had been
dropped into position, it was firmly drifted to the foot-blocks,
previously described, and the excavation made for them was filled with
concrete well rammed about the blocks and rounded off 6 in. above the
surface of the ground. Secure flashings, in two sections, were then made
about the posts to cover the holes made in the gutter and roof, the
bottom sections being firmly soldered to the roof or gutter, and the top
sections, which lapped over the bottom and cleared them 2 in. in all
directions, were firmly nailed to the posts and the joints leaded. This
arrangement allowed the bents to move slightly, and at the same time
made the roof and gutter water-tight. These bents were placed 16 ft. on
centers to correspond with the spacing of the doors of the freight
shed.</p>

<p>Under the cross-overs near Eleventh Avenue, where the tracks had to
be supported in different positions on the caps, and could no longer be
kept over the posts, the caps were trussed and the posts were
reinforced, as shown on Bents "<i>J</i>," "<i>H</i>," and "<i>K</i>," <a
href = "#fig_5">Fig.&nbsp;5</a>.</p>

<p>The trusses for the through bridge over the tracks were erected on
Sunday, April 16th. The two trusses, one 122 ft. and the other 165 ft. 8
in. from center to center of end posts, had been assembled
<span class = "pagenum">358</span>
<a name = "page358"> </a>
and riveted, lying flat on cribwork a few feet above the ground, south
of the permanent position and between the New York Central tracks and
Eleventh Avenue. On the date stated, the contractor, having been given
permission to block the Central's tracks from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.,
erected a large steel gin pole just south of the correct position of the
center of the north truss, which was then dragged, from the place where
it had been assembled, across the railroad tracks until the center of
the bottom chord was vertically under its true position, the truss still
lying flat and about at right angles to the center line of the bridge.
Chains were made fast to the top chord at the middle panel of the truss,
which was then turned up to a vertical plane, raised to its permanent
position, and guyed. The gin pole was then shifted and the operation
repeated with the longer truss, after which, half of the floor beams and
a part of the top laterals were bolted in position and the guys were
removed, the bridge being thus erected without the use of falsework of
any kind. During the lifting there was no sag in either truss that could
be noticed by the eye. Fig. 1, <a href = "#plate_LV">Plate&nbsp;LV</a>,
shows the bridge erected, with the exception of the tight timber
fence.</p>

<p>Pier No. 72 is directly over the North River Tunnels. When it was
turned over by the New York Central Railroad Company, the contractor for
the construction of those tunnels tore down the shed and removed the
deck and such piles as were in the path of the tubes. This left standing
the four northernmost, the four southernmost and two centers rows of
piles for the entire length of the pier. An additional row of piles was
then driven on either side of the two center rows, and battered so that
at the elevation of the tunnels they would be close to the center rows
and leave as much clear space as possible. The pier, therefore, was
constructed of three independent lines of four-post bents, which,
however, rested on sills which were continuous throughout the width of
the pier, as shown by Figs. 2 and 3, <a href =

<p>The bents for the upper floors of the pier were double-decked, with
12 by 12-in. posts, sills, intermediate and top caps, and 3 by 8-in.
longitudinal and cross-bracing. The bents for the incline were similar,
except that those below 16 ft. in height were of single-deck
construction. The spacing of the bents varied from 9 ft. 6 in. to 12
ft., except the three outer bays, which had a span of 23 ft., all to
agree with the position of the pile bents. The double-deck construction
extended for
<span class = "pagenum">360</span>
<a name = "page360"> </a>
the full length of the original pier. A single-deck extension, of full
width and 180 ft. in length, was subsequently built for the
accommodation of four derricks for handling building material and large
rock. The piles for this extension were driven in three sets of four
rows each, similar to those in the old portion of the pier, except that
the bents were driven with a uniform spacing of 15 ft. between centers.
The three sets of bents were topped separately with 12 by 12-in. caps
and 12 by 12-in. dock stringers; they were braced with both cross and
longitudinal low-water bracing, and were tied together by a continuous
12 by 12-in. timber over the dock stringers and 12 by 12-in. packing
pieces from stringer to stringer, each of these ties being supported in
the center of the span over the tunnels by two 2-in. hog rods, Section
"<i>A-A</i>," <a href = "#fig_4">Fig.&nbsp;4</a>.</p>

<p>The south side of the upper deck of the pier carried three sets of
nine hoppers, each set covering 90 ft., a little less than the full
length between bulkheads of the largest deck scows, with 70 ft. clear
between sets, to allow for the length of a scow outside of the bulkhead
and to permit the free movement of boats. Each hopper occupied the full
space between two bents, and, as the caps were topped by strips of
timber of triangular section, with a width of 12 in. on the base and a
height of 6 in., protected by a 6 by 6-in. steel angle, each set of
hoppers presented 90 lin. ft. of continuous dumping room. The bottoms of
the hoppers, set at an angle of 45°, were formed by 12 by 12-in. timbers
laid longitudinally, running continuously throughout each set, and
covered by 3-in. planking. The partitions were formed with 4-in. planks
securely spiked to uprights from the floor of the hoppers to the caps;
these partitions narrowed toward the front and bottom so as to fit
inside the chutes. Each hopper was lined on the bottom and sides with
½-in. steel plates, and the bottoms were subsequently armored with 2 by
1-in. square bars laid 3 in. on centers and bolted through the 12 by
12-in. flooring of the hoppers. The chutes, extending from the bottom of
the hoppers, were 20 ft. long and 7 ft. wide, in the clear; they were
formed entirely of steel plates, channels, and angles, and were
supported from the upper deck of the pier by chains; their lower ends
were 17 ft. above mean high tide and 14 ft. 6 in. from the string piece
of the pier. The hoppers and chutes are shown by Fig. 1, <a href =

<p>A length of 150 ft. of the north side of the pier was for the use of
the contractor for the North River tunnels; it was equipped with a set
<span class = "pagenum">361</span>
<a name = "page361"> </a>
of nine chutes similar to those for the south side; they were used but
little, and were finally removed to make room for a cableway for
unloading sand and crushed stone.</p>

<p>At the foot of the incline there was a bank of eight telphers running
on rails securely bolted to the tops of 20-in. I-beams, which were hung
from stringers resting on the upper caps. The beams were erected in
pairs, each pair being securely braced together and to the trestle posts
to prevent swaying. Each telpher occupied the space between two bents,
about 10 ft., so that the entire bank commanded a length of 80 ft.,
which was approximately the length of a rock scow between bulkheads. All
supports for the telphers were provided as a part of the trestle, but
the machines themselves were a part of the contractor's plant.</p>

<p>Four derricks were erected on the extension, two on the north and two
on the south edge of the pier, supported on bents at a sufficient
elevation above the floor to clear a locomotive.</p>

<p>After most of the earth had been excavated, the out-bound set of
hoppers on the south side of the pier was removed, and two derricks were
erected in their place and used for unloading sand, crushed stone, and
other building material.</p>


<h5 class = "smallcaps">Plant.</h5>

<p>As the use of the 35th Street pier for the disposal of material
required that the mode of transportation should be by dump-wagons drawn
by horses, the plant in use by the contractor during that period
necessarily differed in many respects from what it was later, when Pier
No. 72 was available. Therefore, the nature of the plant during each
period will be stated. The plant for each period will be divided into
five classes:</p>

<h5 class = "ital">1.&mdash;Central Plant.</h5>

<p>(<i>a</i>).&mdash;<i>Power-Generating Plant.</i>&mdash;The
contractor's first central generating plant was established in a 35 by
85-ft. steel-framed building covered with corrugated iron, the long side
being parallel to Ninth Avenue and 15 ft. from the east house line, and
the north end 43 ft. south of the south house line of 32d Street. The
foundations for the building and machinery were of concrete, resting on
bed-rock, the floor being 20 ft. below the level of the Ninth Avenue
curb. The south end of the building was the boiler-room and the north
end the compressor-room, the two being separated by a partition. Coal
was delivered into a large bin, between the boiler-house and Ninth
Avenue, its top being level with the street surface, and its base level
with the boiler-room floor.</p>

<p>At the end of the horse-and-truck period the plant consisted of:</p>

first floor of a 40 by 70-ft. two-story frame structure, which was in
the pit on the north side of 31st Street, 48 ft. east of Ninth Avenue.
The second floor was on the street level, and was used as a storehouse
for hand-tools and small plant.</p>

<p>The blacksmith shop contained: Four forges with hand blowers, four

<p class = "hanging">
The only machinery used on the dock during the horse-and-truck period

described under the head of retaining-wall plant.
</p>

<p>The plant described above does not represent that which was used
during the whole of the horse-and-truck period, but what had accumulated
at the end of it. The power-generating plant might almost have been
omitted from this period, as the first compressor did not begin running
until February, 1905. Previous to that time, the power for drilling,
pumping, driving, sheeting, etc., was steam furnished by the boilers
which subsequently drove the compressors, these being brought on the
ground and fired as occasion required.</p>


<h5>Train-Disposal Period, Beginning May 22d, 1905.</h5>

<p>At the beginning of this period there had been excavated 242,800 cu.
yd. of earth and 22,800 cu. yd. of rock, of the total excavation of
803,500 cu. yd. of earth and 804,000 cu. yd. of rock included in the
principal contract, leaving to be excavated under that contract 560,000
cu. yd. of earth and 781,200 cu. yd. of rock, and an additional contract
had been let to the New York Contracting Company for the terminal power
station, which increased the earth by 16,500 and the rock by 15,500 cu.
yd. During the year following, contracts for the east and west portions
and the sub-structures were let, which brought the total to be
excavated, after the beginning of the train-disposal period, up to
681,000 cu. yd. of earth and 1,494,000 cu. yd. of rock.</p>

<p>The central plant, transportation plant, and dock plant were used
indiscriminately on all these contracts, and, as no separation can be
made which will hold good for any appreciable length of time, the plant
in those classes will be stated in total. The retaining-wall and pit
plant here given include that used on the principal contract and
terminal power station only. The power-generating plant given under the
horse-and-truck period was doubled at the beginning of the
train-disposal period, but it was still insufficient for the work then
under contract, and the additional contracts necessitated a greater
increase. The location had also to be changed to permit the excavation
of the rock under Ninth Avenue. The old stone church fronting on 34th
<span class = "pagenum">365</span>
<a name = "page365"> </a>
Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, a building 68 ft. wide and
92 ft. long, made a roomy and very acceptable compressor-house. The
wooden floors and galleries were removed, and good concrete foundations
were put in, on which to set the plant; the walls, which were cracked in
several places, were trussed apart and prevented from moving outward by
cables passed about the pilasters between the windows.</p>

<p>The boilers were erected south of the church, an ash-pit being first
built, the full width of it, with the floor on a level with the
basement. The rear wall of the church formed the north wall of the
ash-pit, and the south wall and the ends were built of concrete. The
boilers were set with the fire-doors toward the rear wall of the
building, and 7 ft. distant from it, and above this fire-room and the
boilers there was erected a coal-bin of 500 tons capacity. The rear wall
of the compressor-house formed the north wall of the bin, the section of
which was an isosceles right-angled triangle. Coal was delivered by
dumping wagons into a large vault constructed under the sidewalk on 34th
Street, and was taken from there to the bin by a belt conveyor.</p>

<p>The plant for the second period was as follows:</p>

Ninth Avenue power-house which had been erected at that point. The
contents of the blacksmith shop remained the same as for the first

<p>Ground was broken for work under the principal contract on July 9th,
1904, on which date the contractor began cutting asphalt for Trench No.
1 in 31st Street, and also began making a roadway from Ninth Avenue into
the pit just south of 32d Street.</p>

<p><i>Excavation for Retaining Walls.</i>&mdash;Two essentially
different methods were used in excavating for and building the retaining
walls; one, construction in trench, the other, construction on bench. In
general, the trench method was used wherever the rock on which the wall
<span class = "pagenum">368</span>
<a name = "page368"> </a>
was to be founded was 12 ft. or more below the surface of the street;
or, what is perhaps a more exact statement, as it includes the
determining factor, where the buildings adjoining the wall location were
not founded on rock.</p>

<p>In the trench method the base of the wall was staked out on the
surface of the ground, the required width being determined by the
elevation of the rock, as shown by the borings. The contractor then
added as much width as he desired for sheeting and working space, and
excavated to a depth of about 5 ft. before setting any timber. In some
cases the depth of 5 ft. was excavated before the cableway or derrick
for the excavation was erected, the wagons being driven directly into
the excavation and loaded by hand, but, usually, the cableway was first
erected, and buckets were used from the start. After the first 5 ft. had
been excavated, two sets of rangers and struts were set, the first in
the bottom of the excavation and the second at the level of the street
surface, supported by posts resting on the bottom rangers. The sheeting
was then set, and all voids back of it were filled with clean earth and
well tamped. The toe of the sheeting was kept level with the bottom of
the excavation until the ground-water was reached, after which it was
kept from 3 to 5 ft. ahead of the digging.</p>

<p>The sheeting used was 3-in., in variable widths; it was always
tongued and grooved on the side of the trench next to the buildings and
in the deeper excavations on both sides of the trench, and was driven by
wooden mauls above the ground-water level, but steam sheeting-drivers
were used below that elevation. Struts, rangers, and posts were
generally 12 by 12-in.</p>

<p>Some exceedingly bad material was encountered in the deeper
excavations, beds of quicksand being passed through, varying in
thickness from 1 to 18 ft., the latter, in 31st Street between Seventh
and Eighth Avenues, in the deepest excavation made. After encountering
the fine sand in that trench, no headway was made until a tight wooden
cylinder was sunk through the sand by excavating the material inside of
it and heavily weighting the shell with pig iron. When this cylinder had
reached the gravel, which lay below the sand, it was used as a sump, and
the water level was kept below the bottom of the excavation, which
permitted good progress. Sand continued to flow under the sheeting to
such an extent, however, that the front walls of
<span class = "pagenum">369</span>
<a name = "page369"> </a>
four adjoining buildings were badly cracked and had to be taken down and
rebuilt. All the stoops along this trench settled, and had to be
repaired.</p>

<p>The bench method of excavating for the retaining wall was very
simple, and was used only where the rock lay near the surface and the
adjoining buildings were founded on it, the overlying material being in
such case dry, and consequently firm, little or no shoring was required.
The method was to extend the pit excavation to a width of 2 or 3 ft.
beyond the proposed back of the retaining wall, and to carry that width
down to the depth required for its base, below which the excavation was
narrowed to 1 ft. inside of the face of the wall and continued either
before it was built or subsequently.</p>

<p><i>Retaining-Wall Construction.</i>&mdash;The concrete walls were
built in sections 50 ft. in length, except where that spacing would
bring an expansion joint under a girder pocket or just on line with a
tier of struts, in which cases the section was shortened as required.
Trenches were never allowed to remain open at the full depth, the
concreting being started as soon after the necessary length of rock had
been uncovered as the forms and preliminary work for a section could be
prepared. Each section was a monolith, except in a few cases where very
heavy rains made it impossible to hold the laborers.</p>

<p>The various operations in building the concrete wall are shown on
<a href = "#fig_7">Fig.&nbsp;7</a>.
Guide-planks, "<i>a&nbsp;a</i>," Section "<i>A-A</i>," were securely
spiked to alternate tiers of struts for the length of the section, the
face of each guide-plank being set on line with the intended face of the
concrete wall, and 2-in. tongued-and-grooved spruce plank were laid
along the guide-plank to the height of the bottom strut and securely
braced from the front sheeting. A 4-in. brick wall was built
simultaneously on line with the back of the wall to the height of the
first step. Where the bottom strut was below that elevation, the
brickwork was left low at that immediate point and built up when the
strut was removed. The brick wall was then water-proofed on the side
toward the concrete, and loose laps of the water-proofing were allowed
to hang over the brickwork and at least 8 in. down the back. A 6-in.
vitrified pipe drain was then laid along the surface of the rock just
outside of the brick wall, the joints in the pipe being caulked with
oakum saturated in cement, and pointed with cement mortar above a line 1
in. below the horizontal diameter, the remainder of each joint being
left open. Cross-drains
<span class = "pagenum">370</span>
<a name = "page370"> </a>
were laid from tees in the back drain to the face of the wall at all low
points in the rock and at least for every 25 ft. of wall length, the
joints of these discharge pipes being caulked and cemented throughout.
The surface of the rock was then washed and scraped clean, and was
covered with about 1 in. of mortar, after which the section was ready
for concrete.</p>

SKETCH SHOWING FORMS FOR, AND METHOD OF,<br>
CONCRETING RETAINING WALLS IN TRENCH.</span>
</p>

<p>The building of monolithic sections in trenches required that the
thrust from one set of struts be taken by the concrete before the set
above could be removed, and necessarily caused slow progress, the rate
at which concrete was deposited being just sufficient to prevent one
layer from setting before the next layer above could be placed.</p>

<p>The concrete used was mixed in the proportions of 1 part of cement to
3 parts of sand and 6 parts of stone, in 2-bag batches, in ¾-yd. and
1-yd. Ransome portable mixers mounted with air-driven engines on the
same frame. These mixers were placed at the surface, and were charged
with barrows, the correct quantities of sand and stone for each batch
being measured in rectangular boxes previous to loading the barrows. The
concrete was discharged from the mixer into a hopper which divided into
two chutes, only one of which was used at a time, the concrete being
shoveled from the bottom of the chutes to its final position. Facing
mortar, 2 in. thick, was deposited simultaneously with the concrete, and
was kept separate from it by a steel diaphragm until both were in place,
when the diaphragm was removed and the two were spaded together. The
bottoms of the guide-planks were cut off just above the concrete as it
progressed, and, as soon as the wall had reached a strut at one end of
the section, that strut was removed, the form was built up to the next
strut, at front and back, and braced to the sheeting, so that, by the
time the entire length of the section had been carried up to the level
of the first line of struts, forms were ready at one end for the
succeeding layers. The layers of concrete never exceeded 8 in. in
height, and at times there were slight delays in the concreting while
the carpenters made ready the next lift of forms, but such delays were
rarely long enough to permit the concrete to take its
initial&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>After a section of concrete had firmly set, both back and front forms
were removed, and the thrust from the sides of the trench was
transferred directly to the finished wall. The face of the wall was
rubbed with a cement brick to remove the marks of the plank, and
<span class = "pagenum">372</span>
<a name = "page372"> </a>
was then coated with a wash of thin cement grout. The water-proofing and
brick armor were then continued up the back of the wall, the spaces
between the lines of braces being first water-proofed and bricked, and
the braces transferred to the finished surface, after which the omitted
panels were completed. The water-proofing consisted of three layers of
Hydrex felt, of a brand known as Pennsylvania Special, and four layers
of coal-tar pitch. The pitch contained not less than 25% of carbon,
softened at 60° Fahr., and melted at a point between 96° and 106° Fahr.
The melting point was determined by placing 1 gramme of pitch on a lead
disk over a hole, 5/16-in. in diameter, and immersed in water which was
heated at the rate of 1° per min.; the temperature of the water at the
time the pitch ran through the hole was considered as the melting
point.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the water-proofing from being torn at the joint
between sections when they contract from changes in temperature, a
vertical strip of felt, 6 in. wide, was pitched over each joint, lapping
3 in. on each concrete section. The back of this strip was not pitched,
but was covered with pulverized soapstone, so that the water-proofing
sheet was free from the wall for a distance of 3 in. on either side of
each joint.</p>

<p>Concreting was continued during the severest weather, one section
being placed when the thermometer was 5° above zero. When the
thermometer was below the freezing point both sand and stone were heated
by wood fires in large pipes under the supply piles; the temperature of
the mix was taken frequently, and was kept above 40 degrees. Numerous
tests made while the work was in progress showed that, while the
temperature fell slightly soon after the concrete was deposited, it was
always from 2° to 5° higher at the end of 2 hours. The face and back of
the concrete were prevented from freezing by a liberal packing of salt
hay just outside the forms.</p>

<p>A vertical hog trough, 24 in. wide and 9 in. deep, was placed in one
end of each section, for its full height below the bridge seat, into
which the next section keyed, and, when the temperature at the time of
concreting was below 50° Fahr., a compression joint was formed by
placing a strip of heavy deadening felt, 2 ft. wide, on the end of the
completed section next to the face and covering the remainder of the end
with two ply of the felt and pitch water-proofing; the one ply of
deadening felt near the face was about the same thickness as the
<span class = "pagenum">373</span>
<a name = "page373"> </a>
two ply of water-proofing, and was used to prevent the pitch from being
squeezed out of the joint to the face of the wall.</p>

<p>The excavation for the retaining walls in 31st and 33d Streets were
in all cases made of sufficient width to receive the sewers, which were
laid as soon as the back-fill, carefully rammed and puddled, had reached
the proper elevations; the back-filling was then completed, and the gas
and water mains were afterward laid in separate trenches.</p>

<p>The sections of concrete built in trench varied in height from 13 to
59 ft. from the base to the top of the back wall. With the exception of
the Seventh Avenue wall, 50 ft. in height, and the Ninth Avenue wall, 62
ft. in height, none of those sections constructed by the bench method
was more than 14 ft. The forms and bracing for these walls were
substantially the same, except that the low walls were built in lengths
of approximately 50 ft., while the forms for the Seventh and Ninth
Avenue walls were only 20 ft. long.</p>

<p>The forms and bracing for the Ninth Avenue walls are shown on <a href
= "#fig_8">Fig.&nbsp;8</a>. These forms were built in one piece and
moved ahead from section to section, and they were firmly braced from
the bottom with raker braces to a point 36 ft. above the base, the upper
part being held in place by ¾-in. bolts passed through the forms and
anchored by cables to bolts grouted into the rock behind.</p>

After the forms had been set and braced, an 8-in. brick wall was laid
up the face of the rock, containing a vertical line of three-cell hollow
tile block every 5 ft. of length, and laid to conform as nearly as
possible to the face of the rock, all voids being filled with broken
stone. Water-proofing, similar to that described for the walls in the
trench, was then applied to the brick and tile wall for the full height,
and firmly braced to the front forms, the braces being removed as the
concrete reached them. The concrete was mixed at the street level and
deposited through chutes, as described previously.</p>

<p><i>Pit Excavation.</i>&mdash;The pit excavation during the
horse-and-truck period was largely preparatory work done to get the
excavation in good shape for handling spoil trains after Pier No. 72 and
the trestle approach were finished. This required an open cut from Ninth
to Seventh Avenues at a sufficient depth below the sewers and other
substructures in the avenues to clear a locomotive, and wide enough for
both running and loading tracks, also the building of the cast-iron
sewer in Eighth Avenue across the entire excavation, with enough of the
temporary bridging to support it. The building of the trestle in Eighth
Avenue was essentially a part of the pit excavation, as the progress of
one depended greatly on that of the other.</p>

<p>Excavation was commenced on July 12th, 1904, for the crossing under
Ninth Avenue, and in the pit east of Ninth Avenue along 32d Street. The
line chosen for the opening cut was down the center of the pit, as it
was not safe to excavate near the bounding streets until after the
completion of the enclosing retaining wall. The excavation was started
by hand, but three 70-ton Bucyrus steam shovels were put to work as soon
as they could be delivered, the first on July 25th and the third on
September 12th. The excavated material was loaded by the shovels on
end-dump wagons, each having a capacity of 2 cu. yd., and was conveyed
in them to the dumping board at 35th Street. The average number of teams
was 135, 10% being snatch teams to pull the wagons out of the pit and to
assist them up the runway at the dumping board. The teams averaged only
seven trips per day of 10 hours, considerable delay being caused by the
trains of the New York Central Railroad at Eleventh Avenue. The number
of teams
<span class = "pagenum">375</span>
<a name = "page375"> </a>
was not sufficient, therefore, to keep the three shovels busy when they
were all in good digging, but the dumping board was taxed to accommodate
that number, and little would have been gained by increasing it. The
digging was very good during this period, practically no rock being
encountered, and the building foundations were too light to present any
obstacle to such powerful shovels. The capacity of their dippers was 3½
cu. yd., so that one dipperful meant one truck loaded and running over.
The output from August to November, inclusive, averaged 40,000 cu. yd.
per month; one shift only was worked per day, and although the quantity
was not large for three such powerful shovels, it was large to truck
through the streets, and required that one team pass a given point every
18 sec. At the end of November the opening up of the pit had been
accomplished, considerable rock had been stripped near Ninth Avenue, and
the streets had become so icy that the cost of transportation was
practically doubled; work in the pit, therefore, was much curtailed, and
amounted to continuous work for one shovel from that time until the end
of the period, May 22d, 1905, when Pier No. 72 was put in service and
transportation by train began. Figs. 2 and 3, <a href =
"#plate_LVI">Plate&nbsp;LVI</a>, show the condition of the pit east and
west of Eighth Avenue, respectively, on that date.</p>

<p>The work of excavating for and building the temporary street bridge,
a typical bent and bracing for which are shown on <a href =
"#fig_9">Fig.&nbsp;9</a>, and the cast-iron sewer and water mains in
Eighth Avenue, was commenced
<span class = "pagenum">376</span>
<a name = "page376"> </a>
on September 3d, 1904. The trestle was a double-decked structure of
yellow pine, with 10 by 10-in. posts and sills, 10 by 14-in.
intermediate and top caps, and 2 by 10-in. longitudinal and
cross-braces. The trestle was further stiffened longitudinally by four
lines of 8 by 10-in. struts, butted between the intermediate caps, and
held in position by 2 by 8-in. splice-plates resting on top of them. The
intermediate caps were at an elevation of 15 ft. below the surface of
the street, and above that line the longitudinal bracing was continuous,
while below it the bents were braced in pairs, the bracing being omitted
from every second bay. Below the intermediate cap the bents were uniform
for the entire width of the trestle, but the top cap was not continuous,
being 5 ft. below the surface under the trolley tracks, and only 18 in.,
the depth of stringers and planking, beyond. The stringers under the
trolley tracks were 8 by 16-in. yellow pine, spaced three to a track,
and those for the driveway were 6 by 14-in., spaced 1 ft. 6 in. on
centers, the planking being 4-in. yellow pine.</p>

SKETCH SHOWING TYPICAL BENT OF TRESTLE SUPPORTING EIGHTH AVENUE</span>
</p>

<p>The first step in the construction was to excavate a trench 15 ft.
wide on the west side of the street, the east side of the trench being 4
ft. west of the westernmost trolley rail. While this work was in
progress, all vehicular traffic was turned to that part of the avenue
east of the westerly trolley rail. The trench was sheeted and timbered,
and carried to a depth sufficient to receive the intermediate cap. That
portion of the bent from the bottom of the intermediate cap to the
bottom of the top cap was then erected for the width of the trench,
after which the 60-in. cast-iron sewer and the 48-in. water main were
laid in position and caulked. The top cap, stringers, and planking were
then laid, for the full width of the trestle west of the trolley tracks.
This work was finished and the sewage turned into the new sewer in
April, 1905.</p>

<p>As the planking was laid west of the trolley tracks, traffic was
turned to that side of the street, and the material east of the tracks
was excavated to its natural slope. Trenches were then dug under the
tracks on the line of the bents, and the caps were set in position on
blocking. The material between these trenches was then removed, the
tracks being supported meanwhile by blocking at least every 6 ft., and
the stringers and planking were shoved into place. Excavation was next
made between the caps to a depth of about 5 ft. below them, needle-beams
being placed under the caps, one or two at a time, and
<span class = "pagenum">377</span>
<a name = "page377"> </a>
supported on posts erected in these excavations; the material on line of
the bents was excavated to the depth of the intermediate caps, which
were then set, together with the posts and bracing for the upper deck of
the structure. This operation was repeated for the lower deck, about 10
ft. being gained for each change of posts, and three shifts, therefore,
were required.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the train-transportation period, May 22d, 1905,
two shifts of 10 hours each were inaugurated, and the earth was handled
at the rate of from 85,000 to 90,000 cu. yd. per month; but, by the end
of August, when a little more than 60% of the total earth had been
disposed of, the rock began to interfere very greatly with the progress.
The strike of the rock was almost directly north and south, and its
surface formed broken ridges running in that direction, with deep
valleys between. The dip was almost vertical near Ninth Avenue, and
about 70° toward the west near Seventh Avenue. This condition made it
necessary to turn the shovels parallel to the ridges in order to strip
the rock for drilling; and, as the ridges were very broken, the shovels
continued to bump into them on all occasions, making it necessary to
move back and start other cuts or stand and wait for the rock to be
drilled and blasted. One small Vulcan steam shovel, with vertical boiler
and ¾-cu. yd. dipper, had been brought on the work to be used in
stripping rock, and was moved from place to place so much more easily
than the large ones that an Ohio shovel of the same general type was
purchased in October, and thereafter the stripping was done largely by
the two small shovels and by hand, the large shovels being used almost
exclusively in handling rock.</p>

<p>The drilling necessary to remove the rock was very large in amount
and also per yard excavated. In order not to damage the retaining walls
and the rock underlying them, holes spaced at 5-in. centers were drilled
1 ft. away from the face of the walls and on the same batter. These
breaking holes alone amounted to a total of 210,000 lin. ft., or 1 ft.
of hole for each 3½ cu. yd. of rock excavated; and the regulations of
the Bureau of Combustibles, which prevented springing, caused the
blasting holes to be placed very close together and required a total of
about 420,000 lin. ft., making 630,000 ft. If to this is added the block
holes, for some of the rock broke very large, it will show at least 1
ft. of drill hole for each cubic yard of rock excavated, about ten times
the average on general railroad work.</p>

Channeling with a 10-ft quarry bar, carrying a No. 4 Ingersoll-Rand
drill with <span class = "heavy">Z</span>-bits, was attempted in place
of the close drilling below the walls, but, as the rock stood so nearly
vertical and was full of soft seams, very little could be accomplished,
the average cut per day of 10 hours, counting the time of moving and
setting up, was only 4 sq. ft., and, after a thorough trial, the bars
were abandoned.</p>

<p><i>Disposal.</i>&mdash;The excavated material was hauled from the
shovels to the pier in 10-car trains. The cars were of three classes:
4-yd. Western dump-cars, flat cars without skips, and flats carrying
specially designed steel skips having a capacity of 4 cu. yd. each. As
far as practicable, earth, and rock containing 1 cu. yd. or less, was
loaded on dumpers, medium-sized rock on the skips, and large rock on the
bare flats. As a steam shovel must pick up what is nearest to it first,
however, this classification could not always be adhered to, and many
large rocks were loaded into dumpers. Cars of this class which contained
no material too large to dump were run at once to the hoppers, and were
dumped and returned to the pit; others, together with the flat and skip
cars, were run down the incline to the derricks and telphers, where the
flats and skips were entirely unloaded, and the large rocks ware removed
from the dumpers, after which they were run to the hoppers and
emptied.</p>

<p>The total quantity of excavated material handled at this pier from
May 22d, 1905, to December 31st, 1908, amounted to 673,800 cu. yd. of
earth and 1,488,000 cu. yd. of rock, place measurement, equal to
3,203,400 cu. yd., scow measurement; in addition to which 175,000 cu.
yd. of crushed stone and sand and 6,000 car loads of miscellaneous
building material were transferred from scows and lighters to small cars
for delivery to the Terminal work.</p>

<p>All the earth and 570,000 cu. yd. of the rock, place measurement,
were handled through the chutes, and the remainder of the rock, 918,000
cu. yd., and all the incoming material by the derricks and telphers. In
capacity to handle material, one telpher was about equal to one derrick.
A train, therefore, could be emptied or a boat loaded under the bank of
eight telphers in one-fourth the time required by the derricks, of which
only two could work on one boat. The telphers, therefore, were of great
advantage where track room and scow berths were limited.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">385</span>

the scows at both the 35th Street dumping board and Pier No. 72 were
furnished, towed, and the material finally disposed of, by Henry Steers,
Incorporated. During the same period, this contractor disposed of the
material excavated from both the Cross-town Tunnels, constructed by the
United Engineering and Contracting Company, and the tunnels under the
East River, constructed by S. Pearson and Son, Incorporated. As stated
in other papers of this series relating to the construction of those
tunnels, the material excavated by the United Engineering and
Contracting Company was delivered to barges at 35th Street and East
River and that by S. Pearson and Son, Incorporated, at two points, one
in Long Island City and the other at 33d Street and East River,
Manhattan.</p>

was&nbsp;14), and, as the average time spent in one round trip was
3&nbsp;1/3 days, a fleet of more than 50 scows was required to keep all
points supplied and allow for a few to be out of service undergoing
repairs.</p>

<p>All loaded scows were towed from the docks, with the ebb tide, to a
stake boat anchored in the bay about one mile off shore at Greenville;
and were taken from there to the different unloading points, as
required, by smaller tugs which also returned the empty scows to the
stake.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">386</span>
<a name = "page386"> </a>
The unloading plants were similar at the different points, although that
at Greenville was much larger than the others. It included five land
dredges and eight traveling derricks of two types, one floating and the
other mounted on wheels and traveling on a track of 16-ft. gauge. The
derricks handled the large rock, which was loaded at Pier No. 72 by
derricks and telphers. They were of the ordinary <span class =
"heavy">A</span>-frame type, and were designed to handle 20 tons. They
were operated by 9 by 10-in. Lidgerwood double-drum and swinging-gear
engines. The large rock was deposited by the derricks either in the
channels along which they worked or in the fill along shore, without the
use of cars. The land dredges were equipped with a 60-ft. boom and a
2½-yd. Hayward bucket operated by a 14 by 18-in. double-drum Lidgerwood
dredging engine. They loaded into 9-yd., standard-gauge, side-dump cars,
built by the contractor, and unloaded the scows to within about 1 ft. of
the deck, a Hayward bucket being unsuitable for closer work without
greatly damaging the scows. The material remaining was loaded by hand
into skips which were handled to the cars by small derricks, one of
which was located at the rear of each dredge. The cars were taken to the
dump and returned by 25-ton, standard-gauge, engines which had
previously done service on the Manhattan Elevated Railroad, but were
spotted for loading by the engine on the dredge.</p>

<p>In order to keep a record of the fleet of scows, which would show the
available supply at a glance, a board, 10 by 15 in., and covered with a
heavy sheet of ruled paper, was arranged as shown by <a href =
"#fig_10">Fig.&nbsp;10</a>. It was divided into 12 vertical columns, the
first of which was headed "Scows," and contained the name or number of
each scow in service. The next four columns denoted loading points, and
were headed "Pier No. 72," "Thirty-third Street, East River,"
"Thirty-fifth Street, East River," and "Long Island City," respectively;
the sixth column was headed "Greenville," the seventh "Hackensack," the
eighth "Passaic," and the ninth "Governors Island," being unloading
points, the tenth and eleventh, "Stake Boat" and "Dry Dock,"
respectively, while the twelfth was for "Extra pins," not in use. To
indicate the condition of the scows, small pins with colored heads were
used; white indicated empty; blue, working; black, loaded; red, being
repaired; and a pearl-colored pin, missing. Thus a white-headed pin
opposite the number 6 in the column headed Pier No. 72 indicated that
scow No. 6 was lying at that pier waiting to be placed in position for
<span class = "pagenum">387</span>
<a name = "page387"> </a>
loading, whereas a black-headed pin at the same point meant that the
scow had received its load and was ready to be towed.</p>

RECORDING LOCATION AND CONDITION OF SCOWS</span>
</p>

<p>The scows were all taken from the general service about the harbor;
some of them were practically new, while others had seen much service.
They were of two general types, truss-framed or bulkhead-framed; all
were flat-bottomed, with a rake of about 45° at bow and stern. The
truss-framed scows were built with a cross-truss every 10 to 15 ft., on
which rested, fore and aft, two classes of beams, main and intermediate.
The main beams were built of timbers ranging from 10 by 10 in. to 14 by
14 in., were scarfed at the joints, and trussed with the bottom logs.
The intermediate beams were of timbers varying from 6 by 6 in. to 10 by
12 in., had butt joints, and were dapped at the cross-trusses to give a
convex surface to the deck, which was built of 3-in. and 4-in. plank,
from 8 to 12 in. in width, running athwartship. The sides of the scows
of this class were spiked and bolted to trusses similar to those running
under the main beams. The bulkheaded boats had both sides and two
longitudinal bulkheads placed so as to divide the scow into three
sections of equal width, built of 8 by 8-in. or 10 by 10-in. timbers,
laid one upon the other, and bolted through from top to bottom. The
beams on these boats ran athwartship, rested on sides and bulkheads, and
ranged from 6 by 10-in. to 10 by 12-in., spaced 2 ft. apart, and dressed
to give a convex surface to the deck, which
<span class = "pagenum">388</span>
<a name = "page388"> </a>
was usually 3 in., in some cases 4 in., in thickness, and made up of
narrow plank from 4 to 6 in. in width.</p>

<p>These boats had all been designed for lighter work than they were
here required to perform, and a large amount of breakage occurred from
the start. In order that the contractors for the excavation should be
unhampered as to method of loading, the contracts provided that they
should pay for all damage done to the scows in loading, other than
ordinary and usual wear and tear, all other damage being at the expense
of the contractor for the disposal. A rigid system of inspection was
necessary to determine and record properly the damage for which each
contractor was responsible; and, as much of the breakage could not be
noticed from the exterior, a thorough examination of the interior of
each scow was made before and after every loading. In
<span class = "pagenum">389</span>
<a name = "page389"> </a>
order to keep proper records, the bays of each scow, formed by the
cross-trusses, were numbered, beginning aft with number 1 and going
forward to the bow, and the longitudinal bays formed by the main beams
were lettered, beginning with "<i>A</i>" on the port side. A beam broken
in "1-<i>A</i>," therefore, would be an intermediate beam in the stern
port corner bay, and a beam broken in "10-<i>A-B</i>" would be a main
beam at the bow end on the port side. The underside of each plank was
marked with a number beginning with 1 at the stern and increasing by
unity to the bow. <a href = "#fig_11">Fig.&nbsp;11</a> is a diagram of a
scow in accordance with this system. In addition to recording the date,
location, extent, and party responsible for each damage, in a book kept
for that purpose, the injured member was marked with paint, the color of
which indicated the party responsible. The repairs were made by the
contractor for the disposal of material, and the cost was assessed
according to the marking in the boat.</p>

</p>

<p>The careful inspection of the damage done to scows and the cost of
their repairs enables a fairly accurate statement to be made of the
amount at different points, and it is here given on the basis of cost of
repairs per cubic yard, barge measurement, of material handled.</p>

<p>The above figures do not include the expense due to scows which were
overturned or sunk while in the service, which amounted to 0.4 cent per
cubic yard, additional.</p>

<p><i>Ninth Avenue Tunnels.</i>&mdash;The two double-track tunnels under
Ninth Avenue, constructed to obtain 100 ft. of additional tail room on
each of four tracks, required an excavation 76 ft. wide, <a href =
"#fig_12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>. The rock, although fair, was not firm enough
for so great a span, and, to obviate the necessity of timbering, the
center wall was built before excavating
<span class = "pagenum">390</span>
<a name = "page390"> </a>
for the full width. The dip of the rock at this point is almost 90°, and
to prevent blowing away the entire face in excavating for the tunnel,
the pit excavation was not carried west to the final face below the
springing line, a 10-ft. bench being left at that elevation. A top
heading 9 ft. high and 10 ft. wide was started above that bench and,
after penetrating about 10 ft., was widened to 20 ft. A cross-heading
was driven in each direction at the west end of the first heading; the
bench was then shot down, and the first 10 ft. of the longitudinal
heading was widened sufficiently to receive the center wall, <a href =
"#fig_12">Fig.&nbsp;12</a>. After the middle wall had been concreted,
any voids between its top and the rock were grouted through pipes left
for that purpose; the wall was then protected by curtains of heavy round
timber securely wired together, and the remainder of the excavation was
made by widening the cross-headings toward the face. The muck was
carried out by two cableways, one on each side of the completed middle
wall, each of which was supported by a tower outside of the tunnel and a
large hook-bolt grouted into the rock at the inner end of the tunnel.
Forms were built for each tunnel complete, and the concrete was
delivered by a belt conveyor, running over the top of the lagging, and
moved out as the tunnel was keyed.</p>

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
